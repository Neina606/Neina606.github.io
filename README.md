Workout Journal is a personal fitness planning website that allows users to organize and track their weekly workout routines in one place. Designed as a simple static webpage using HTML and CSS, this journal helps users:

- Enter their name to personalize their experience
- Choose how many days per week they plan to work out
- Select a body part to focus on, with the site suggesting exercises based on that selection
- Plan their weekly routine with a body part assigned to each day (Monday to Sunday)
- Log their starting dumbbell weight, session intensity (1â€“10), and post-workout reflections
- Track weekly progress, including:
  - Whether they trained on each day
  - How each session felt (notes section)

The website is purely client-side and does not store any user data between sessions. Once the page is refreshed or closed, all inputs will reset.
